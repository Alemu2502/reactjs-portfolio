Installing Docker Desktop
Download Docker Desktop:

Docker Desktop for Windows: https://desktop.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe

Docker Desktop for Mac: https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg

Install Docker Desktop: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Check Docker Version: Open your Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

docker --version
Enabling WSL 2 (Windows Users)
Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux: Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

wsl --install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
Enable Virtual Machine Platform: Still in PowerShell, run:

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
Install Docker in WSL: After setting up WSL, install Docker:

sudo apt-get install docker.io
Add User to Docker Group (optional): If you want to run Docker commands without sudo, add your user to the Docker group:

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
For more information on setting up WSL 2 with Docker Desktop, see WSL Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/

> Note: Docker only supports Docker Desktop on Windows for those versions of Windows that are still within Microsoftâ€™s servicing timeline. Docker Desktop is not supported on server versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022. For more information on how to run containers on Windows Server, see Microsoft's official documentation.

> Important: To run Windows containers, you need Windows 10 or Windows 11 Professional or Enterprise edition. Windows Home or Education editions only allow you to run Linux containers.
